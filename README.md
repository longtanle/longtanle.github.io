## Information about Helium
At it's core, dactl is a forked version of [sentenza](https://github.com/sentenza/jekyll-material-design) but it has been almost entirely rewritten from scratch.  
I have just started my journey in the world of web development, learning new things on the way.  
Looking for a way to put my newly acquired skills to test I found Jekyll and I quickly realized that it's going to be a good learning experience since I don't like building 'dummy' projects.  
I've built this theme as a way to develop my skills further.

**All** feedback is welcome, both positive and negative.

## Additional information about some features
### Hero images and blog layout
Liquid 'script' which is used to append correct hero image and overlay color as set in post YAML Front matter was written by me and while it's really basic it functions properly.  
You can read more about it and see the code in `include/utils/hero.html`.

#### Tags & Tags Pages
Tags and tag pages are supported by using Jekyll's native collections functionality.

### Inspiration and thoughtful code-jacking
Inspiration and bits of things listed below are present inside dactl's code:
- [Daktilo](https://github.com/kronik3r/daktilo) - dactl is based on Daktilo and inherits it's one-column layout.
- [Hydejack](https://github.com/qwtel/hydejack/) - I've learned a lot about Jekyll when I took apart [@qwtel](https://github.com/qwtel/)'s excellent fork of [Hyde](https://github.com/poole/hyde) theme. I embraced his more partials = everything is easier to edit policy. Hydejack theme gave me an idea on how to create hero images liquid scripting, loading google fonts and using rem's/em's and more.
- [Minimal Mistakes](https://github.com/mmistakes/minimal-mistakes) - This guy makes awesome themes and writes a lot about Jekyll and it's more obscure use cases on his blog, [Made Mistakes](https://mademistakes.com). Looking through his theme's code - Minimal Mistakes in particular - gave me lot of information about how to build a robust theme and how to make it configurable within `_config.yml`
- [Trophy](https://github.com/thomasvaeth/trophy-jekyll) - Link border slide animation SASS mixin which I slightly modified to be able to easily change the direction of the animation.
- Various blog posts about Jekyll and [Stackoverflow](https://www.stackoverflow.com) posts with useful [Liquid](https://github.com/Shopify/liquid) snippets.
